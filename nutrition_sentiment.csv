The first is very practical and accurate, the second is a bit weird. The first visual is a car’s fuel gauge. If the car runs out of gas, you are totally screwed. You might be stuck on the side of a mountain road, at night, in a snowstorm. You might get hit by a truck just because you ran out of gas.

You don’t want your car to run out of fuel, and you personally don’t want to run out of food energy. You will get headaches, you will get dizzy, you might stumble off a curb and get hit by a truck, maybe even the same truck. However, and this is important, you almost never need to be full.

In America there are gas stations every 10 miles, far more in some places. There’s just no reason to have a belly full of food, since almost every gas station these days has more calories than a small country had a thousand years ago. If you really get hungry, have a snack, order a pizza, grab an apple, drink a Coolatta, it’s not a big deal.

So have three meals a day, but keep your tank about half full, less snacks, no dessert, more water, less second helpings. The second visual is if you are “hungry” and tempted to eat an unhealthy snack or dessert, or tempted to have a third or fourth piece of pizza, or ice cream, or a bowl of cereal late at night, imagine this, imagine you are at a table and sitting across from you is one of your ancestors from 10,000 years ago.

The person across the table is dirty, their hair is matted, and they have not eaten in six days. No one in their family has eaten in six days, no one in their entire tribe. No person they’ve met or ever will meet in their entire life has eaten in six days because it’s winter, they are not having luck hunting, and there simply is no food to be found.

In all likelihood, if things don't turn around quickly, that person, everyone in their family, and everyone in their tribe will be dead inside of two months.

Now imagine that the snack is in the middle of the table, and before you eat it you need to explain to the smelly person why it is that you, someone who almost always has three meals a day, someone who will have three meals today, someone who will have three meals for every day the rest of the year, someone who has ample body fat, someone has a pantry full of food and a wallet full of credit cards, needs the snack more than they do.

You could start with something like, “Og, while it's true that six days is a long time, I don’t think you’re fully appreciating the stress that I'm under at work...” and then THUMP, your head is smashed into the table by Og right before he grabs the snack and divides it among his five children.

And that’s their sole purpose. Therefore, we  just pee out the excess. In clinic we rarely see anyone with a vitamin deficiency.

People health conscious enough to be on this sub would pretty much have to actively try to get a vitamin deficiency and you'd know when it happens because there’s symptoms. Additionally I know a lot of people around here are trying to lose weight or up their fitness, so you're already getting too many nutrients or know to not eat only chicken mcnuggets every meal. 

There's some evidence that a partial Vit D deficiency can have mental effects like lethargy, so if you're worried about that then take a Vit D supplement, but you really do not need to worry about whether your diet is getting enough nutrients or if things like tea are going to prevent you from getting nutrients. Just eat a balanced diet in moderation. If you’re consuming most food groups most days, you’re fine.

While it is true that fat contains more calories per gram than carbohydrates and protein, eating fat does not directly cause weight gain. In fact, certain types of fats, such as unsaturated fats, can be part of a healthy diet and are important for heart health.*

*Another common nutrition myth is that carbohydrates are bad for you. This is also not true. Carbohydrates are an important source of energy for the body and are found in many healthy foods, such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes.*

*It's also a myth that all processed foods are unhealthy. Some processed foods, such as canned fruits and vegetables, can be a convenient and nutritious part of a balanced diet. However, it's important to be mindful of the amount and type of processing that foods undergo and to limit those that are high in added sugars, salt, and unhealthy fats.*

*It's important to base your nutrition choices on scientific evidence and to be skeptical of diets or eating patterns that are not supported by credible research.

Since people are probably not heading out the grocery stores as often, I wanted to share some tips I use to keep my produce fresh, which saves money, and will reduce how often I need to go to the store since I can buy more when I'm there.I feel like I also eat more veg when I do this, because it is easier to see them this way than stuck in the vegetable drawers.

\*\*Greens\*\*: Kale, chard, asparagus, broccoli, mustard greens, collards, etc: I put these in old pickle jars (or whatever size jar will work best for them based on size, remove any rubberbands or bread ties, and fill the jar with water. I moved the middle drawer in my fridge up to a higher rack so it was easier to do this. I have also stored them in the fridge door. It makes using them a lot easier, since you just pluck a few out the jar when you need them.

\*\*Carrots and celery\*\*: I cut the stalks or the carrots into thirds and store them in a covered container filled with water. Sometimes I have carrots and celery on the brink of death of this always brings them back to life after a day or two. Try to change the water every few days if you remember. Sometimes I will chop half the veg into thirds, and the other half I will chop into thirds and then quarter (carrots) or halve (celery) each third so they are ready for dipping into hummus. Makes grabbing a healthy snack easier when they are already cut up and ready to go.

\*\*Berries\*\*: Let the berries soak in a mix of distilled white vinegar and water for 10-15 minutes and then dry on a towel. While they are drying soak the container they are in, in the vinegar water. You only need like 1 part vinegar for 19 parts water to prevent food borne pathogens (they die at a pH of below 4.6, this ratio is about 3.7 pH if using 5% vinegar). I keep my vinegar in a squeezable, refillable container, so I probably end up with a higher vinegar ratio. Doing this prevents the berries from getting moldy. \*Very important not to store the berries in a covered, air tight, plastic container, as the humidity is too high and they will go bad.\* The berries release gas as they ripen, this gas needs to escape or it speeds up the ripening process. Just use the container they came in at the store (after rinsing with the vinegar solution), or store \*uncovered\* in a plastic or glass container without air holes and a paper towel at the bottom to collect any moisture. Check the paper towel for weird stuff and replace if it starts to look like it needs replacing.

Not a vegetable, but if you buy \*\*bread\*\* from a bakery, store it cut side down (or facing the bag) in a paper bag and fold over to increase shelf life.

Looking for advisement on spinach, and cauliflower, cucumber, and zucchini. Right now I just put a paper towel in the spinach bag to try to and grab any excess water in there. Cucumber, I remember my dad storing in salted water, but I haven't done this in decades.

Sometimes I will chop half the veg into thirds, and the other half I will chop into thirds and then quarter (carrots) or halve (celery) each third so they are ready for dipping into hummus. Makes grabbing a healthy snack easier when they are already cut up and ready to go.</p>

<p>**Berries**: Let the berries soak in a mix of distilled white vinegar and water for 10-15 minutes and then dry on a towel. While they are drying soak the container they are in, in the vinegar water. You only need like 1 part vinegar for 19 parts water to prevent food borne pathogens (they die at a pH of below 4.6, this ratio is about 3.7 pH if using 5% vinegar). I keep my vinegar in a squeezable, refillable container, so I probably end up with a higher vinegar ratio. Doing this prevents the berries from getting moldy. *Very important not to store the berries in a covered, air tight, plastic container, as the humidity is too high and they will go bad.* The berries release gas as they ripen, this gas needs to escape or it speeds up the ripening process. Just use the container they came in at the store (after rinsing with the vinegar solution), or store *uncovered* in a plastic or glass container without air holes and a paper towel at the bottom to collect any moisture. Check the paper towel for weird stuff and replace if it starts to look like it needs replacing.</p>

<p>Not a vegetable, but if you buy **bread** from a bakery, store it cut side down (or facing the bag) in a paper bag and fold over to increase shelf life.</p>

<p>Looking for advisement on spinach, and cauliflower, cucumber, and zucchini. Right now I just put a paper towel in the spinach bag to try to and grab any excess water in there. Cucumber, I remember my dad storing in salted water, but I haven&#39;t done this in decades.</p>

<p>**What tips do you have to keep your veg fresh?**  </p>

<p>Edit: The vinegar mixture can also be used a veggie wash, since that stuff is expensive and probably not stocked at the store. Distilled vinegar is cheap.</p>

2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x0000025A147D1460>,,nutrition,"Sorry if my title sounds clickbait-y, and I admit this is probably common knowledge on this subreddit (especially for those who count calories), but I decided to share my approach on why it is so hard for many people to lose or gain weight. 

Going in-depth with examples and scenarios is a good way to truly understand what's going on from day-to-day and why two persons who appear to eat the same thing might have totally different bodies (fat vs skinny).


So... let's start.

**#1 : Consistency is key**

Don't think of one day, think of **one week**. If you don't count calories, it's easy to get misleading approximations about what you eat, especially if you do not have a routine. Not all meals are equal, some are definitely more calorie dense than others even if they appear to be as filling. 

Let's say your maintenance level is at 2300 calories, and you try to make some efforts to lose some weight in a non-drastic way (averaging -300 to -400 calories per day). Let's see how it might pan out on a whole week :

- Day 1 : 1900 calories (-400)

- Day 2 : 2000 calories (-300)

- Day 3 : 3000 calories (+700) (You underestimated a meal and drank two beers with your buddy)

- Day 4 : 2000 calories (-300)

- Day 5 : 2950 calories (+650) (Friday)

- Day 6 : 2050 calories (-250) 

- Day 7 : 2000 calories (-300)


In your mind, you thought you did a good job. Overall, you had 5 successful days!

The problem is that if you combine the numbers, you end up with only a -200 negative result over the whole week, which is roughly -29 calories per day. At the end of your next week, if you end up with a +200 positive result, you've basically been at maintenance for two weeks!

Being consistent is hard, as all it takes is a single day to screw you over (same for gaining weight). That's why counting calories is so effective. If you knew at days #3 and #5 that you consumed a total of 1350 extra calories, you'd make sure to consume a greater deficit during the remaining days.

Being active, doing cardio and playing sports regularly also help, as it helps you being consistent on the negative side. If you subtract an average of 150 calories per day because of your active life, then suddenly, you end up with -1250 calories at the end of the week despise eating way too much on days #3 and #5. Not too bad!

**#2 : Don't underestimate cheat days**


Similar to reason #1, but in a more drastic way. Let's say you have a proper diet, not counting calories, and every Friday you tell yourself ""fuck my diet for tonight, I'm gonna eat pizza and drink booze"".

To simplify things, let's assume that from days 1 to 6, you average -250 calories per day, which is a slow-ish deficit rate. That's -1500 calories over 6 days.

Now, friday night. Your friends are over, you eat pizza. That meal consists of an extra 500 calories than usual. Over the night, you drink some beers, about 4 regular ones. That's about 500 calories. During the whole evening and night, you also eat some chips or other junk food for an extra 500 calories.

Boom, that's an extra 1500 calories. You went from a negative -1500 calories to a maintenance level just because you ate pizza, drank 4 beers and ate some chips in the span of no more than a couple hours!

This is exactly why diets like keto work so well with most people. Keto doesn't allow you to have cheat days like this, because naturally most cheat days consist of an insane amount of carbs. (Most) people don't go on cheat days and eat 4 avocados, 1/2 lb of nuts or 2 kilos of tofu. They go on cheat days and proceed to eat junk food and beer. In other words, carbs aren't the devil, they just happen to be present in most junk-food we eat. 

**#3 : It's all in the small details**

Small details can make a **drastic difference** over a long period of time. When people say ""I don't eat that much and I'm fat!"" or ""I eat a lot and don't gain weight!"", they tend to forget about the small details of their daily routine.

Let's take person A and person B working in an office. Both seem like they eat pretty much the same thing, but person B will definitely become fatter.

- Breakfast : Person B drinks an extra glass of milk. +140 calories

- Snack : Person A doesn't snack before lunch. Person B eats a small amount of nuts in his cubicle. +100 calories

- Lunch : Person A uses mustard in his sandwich. Person B uses mayonnaise. +90 calories

- Snack : Person A doesn't snack before dinner. Person B eats a banana in his cubicle. +90 calories

- Dinner : Person A and B both eat the same meal.

- Late evening : Person A doesn't eat anything. Person B eats a small portion of yogurt before going to bed. +80 calories

- Throughout the day : Person A drank two black coffees. Person B drank two coffees with milk and sugar. +80 calories

Overall, person B has consumed an **extra 580 calories!** And yet, both persons ate very similar meals (breakfast, lunch and dinner), and person B did eat healthy food as snacks, so as an outside perspective it's hard to imagine that person B might get much fatter than person A.

Also, small details appear within a meal :

- How much oil do you use? Do you like your salads with a crapload of vinaigrette, or a small amount? Do you use a lot of mayo, or little mayo or any other low-calorie dense condiments? Do you often incorporate butter in your meals? Do you drink milk/juice, or only water? Do you add milk and sugar in your coffee? Do you pour sauces over your meat? How often do you eat desserts? Are you more of a red meat consumer, or a white meat / fish consumer? Do you put grated parmesan on all pasta dishes? Do you consume bread with your pasta dishes? Do you generally drink light beers or calorie dense craft beers such as IPAs?

I could go on and on... small details can add up, *really* fast.


**#4 : Just because it's healthy or healthier doesn't mean it won't make you fatter**


It's easy to assume that just because you eat healthy food, you're going to lose weight. But unless you go from a really shitty diet to a really healthy diet, it doesn't mean you're going to lose weight.

A banana has nearly 100 calories. An apple has nearly 60 calories. Avocados are high in calories, as well as nuts. If you eat brown bread or pasta, it's still packed with calories, it's just healthier for you than white bread/pasta. Your ""healthy"" granola bar has probably the same amount of calories than your crappy one. etc...

Incorporating healthy snacks throughout the day can be problematic if you weren't eating snacks before, for example. *""I'm gonna start eating more fruits!""* Simply switching to a more healthier brand won't necessarily make a difference (granola bars, chips, crackers, etc) either. Yes, healthy foods can make you feel full more easily, reducing your hunger, which can potentially make you lose weight over a long period of time... but you can't take healthy food for granted. Calories are calories, so whenever you look up a ""healthy looking"" product, look up for the label. 

**Heck, some people might grab a healthier brand of chips that has about 60% the amount of calories than Doritos, but they end up eating more of it!** Because they know it's technically healthier and less calorie dense, in their mind, they can eat more of it without feeling guilty. At the end of the day, you're still going to consume a crazy amount of calories.

<p>Going in-depth with examples and scenarios is a good way to truly understand what&#39;s going on from day-to-day and why two persons who appear to eat the same thing might have totally different bodies (fat vs skinny).</p>

<p>So... let&#39;s start.</p>

<p><strong>#1 : Consistency is key</strong></p>

<p>Don&#39;t think of one day, think of <strong>one week</strong>. If you don&#39;t count calories, it&#39;s easy to get misleading approximations about what you eat, especially if you do not have a routine. Not all meals are equal, some are definitely more calorie dense than others even if they appear to be as filling. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s say your maintenance level is at 2300 calories, and you try to make some efforts to lose some weight in a non-drastic way (averaging -300 to -400 calories per day). Let&#39;s see how it might pan out on a whole week :</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Day 1 : 1900 calories (-400)</p></li>
<li><p>Day 2 : 2000 calories (-300)</p></li>
<li><p>Day 3 : 3000 calories (+700) (You underestimated a meal and drank two beers with your buddy)</p></li>
<li><p>Day 4 : 2000 calories (-300)</p></li>
<li><p>Day 5 : 2950 calories (+650) (Friday)</p></li>
<li><p>Day 6 : 2050 calories (-250) </p></li>
<li><p>Day 7 : 2000 calories (-300)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>In your mind, you thought you did a good job. Overall, you had 5 successful days!</p>

<p>The problem is that if you combine the numbers, you end up with only a -200 negative result over the whole week, which is roughly -29 calories per day. At the end of your next week, if you end up with a +200 positive result, you&#39;ve basically been at maintenance for two weeks!</p>

<p>Being consistent is hard, as all it takes is a single day to screw you over (same for gaining weight). That&#39;s why counting calories is so effective. If you knew at days #3 and #5 that you consumed a total of 1350 extra calories, you&#39;d make sure to consume a greater deficit during the remaining days.</p>

<p>Being active, doing cardio and playing sports regularly also help, as it helps you being consistent on the negative side. If you subtract an average of 150 calories per day because of your active life, then suddenly, you end up with -1250 calories at the end of the week despise eating way too much on days #3 and #5. Not too bad!</p>

<p><strong>#2 : Don&#39;t underestimate cheat days</strong></p>

<p>Similar to reason #1, but in a more drastic way. Let&#39;s say you have a proper diet, not counting calories, and every Friday you tell yourself &quot;fuck my diet for tonight, I&#39;m gonna eat pizza and drink booze&quot;.</p>

<p>To simplify things, let&#39;s assume that from days 1 to 6, you average -250 calories per day, which is a slow-ish deficit rate. That&#39;s -1500 calories over 6 days.</p>

<p>Now, friday night. Your friends are over, you eat pizza. That meal consists of an extra 500 calories than usual. Over the night, you drink some beers, about 4 regular ones. That&#39;s about 500 calories. During the whole evening and night, you also eat some chips or other junk food for an extra 500 calories.</p>

<p>Boom, that&#39;s an extra 1500 calories. You went from a negative -1500 calories to a maintenance level just because you ate pizza, drank 4 beers and ate some chips in the span of no more than a couple hours!</p>

<p>This is exactly why diets like keto work so well with most people. Keto doesn&#39;t allow you to have cheat days like this, because naturally most cheat days consist of an insane amount of carbs. (Most) people don&#39;t go on cheat days and eat 4 avocados, 1/2 lb of nuts or 2 kilos of tofu. They go on cheat days and proceed to eat junk food and beer. In other words, carbs aren&#39;t the devil, they just happen to be present in most junk-food we eat. </p>

<p><strong>#3 : It&#39;s all in the small details</strong></p>

<p>Small details can make a <strong>drastic difference</strong> over a long period of time. When people say &quot;I don&#39;t eat that much and I&#39;m fat!&quot; or &quot;I eat a lot and don&#39;t gain weight!&quot;, they tend to forget about the small details of their daily routine.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s take person A and person B working in an office. Both seem like they eat pretty much the same thing, but person B will definitely become fatter.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Breakfast : Person B drinks an extra glass of milk. +140 calories</p></li>
<li><p>Snack : Person A doesn&#39;t snack before lunch. Person B eats a small amount of nuts in his cubicle. +100 calories</p></li>
<li><p>Lunch : Person A uses mustard in his sandwich. Person B uses mayonnaise. +90 calories</p></li>
<li><p>Snack : Person A doesn&#39;t snack before dinner. Person B eats a banana in his cubicle. +90 calories</p></li>
<li><p>Dinner : Person A and B both eat the same meal.</p></li>
<li><p>Late evening : Person A doesn&#39;t eat anything. Person B eats a small portion of yogurt before going to bed. +80 calories</p></li>
<li><p>Throughout the day : Person A drank two black coffees. Person B drank two coffees with milk and sugar. +80 calories</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Overall, person B has consumed an <strong>extra 580 calories!</strong> And yet, both persons ate very similar meals (breakfast, lunch and dinner), and person B did eat healthy food as snacks, so as an outside perspective it&#39;s hard to imagine that person B might get much fatter than person A.</p>

<p>Also, small details appear within a meal :</p>

<ul>
<li>How much oil do you use? Do you like your salads with a crapload of vinaigrette, or a small amount? Do you use a lot of mayo, or little mayo or any other low-calorie dense condiments? Do you often incorporate butter in your meals? Do you drink milk/juice, or only water? Do you add milk and sugar in your coffee? Do you pour sauces over your meat? How often do you eat desserts? Are you more of a red meat consumer, or a white meat / fish consumer? Do you put grated parmesan on all pasta dishes? Do you consume bread with your pasta dishes? Do you generally drink light beers or calorie dense craft beers such as IPAs?</li>
</ul>

<p>I could go on and on... small details can add up, <em>really</em> fast.</p>

<p><strong>#4 : Just because it&#39;s healthy or healthier doesn&#39;t mean it won&#39;t make you fatter</strong></p>

<p>It&#39;s easy to assume that just because you eat healthy food, you&#39;re going to lose weight. But unless you go from a really shitty diet to a really healthy diet, it doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re going to lose weight.</p>

<p>A banana has nearly 100 calories. An apple has nearly 60 calories. Avocados are high in calories, as well as nuts. If you eat brown bread or pasta, it&#39;s still packed with calories, it&#39;s just healthier for you than white bread/pasta. Your &quot;healthy&quot; granola bar has probably the same amount of calories than your crappy one. etc...</p>

<p>Incorporating healthy snacks throughout the day can be problematic if you weren&#39;t eating snacks before, for example. <em>&quot;I&#39;m gonna start eating more fruits!&quot;</em> Simply switching to a more healthier brand won&#39;t necessarily make a difference (granola bars, chips, crackers, etc) either. Yes, healthy foods can make you feel full more easily, reducing your hunger, which can potentially make you lose weight over a long period of time... but you can&#39;t take healthy food for granted. Calories are calories, so whenever you look up a &quot;healthy looking&quot; product, look up for the label. </p>

<p><strong>Heck, some people might grab a healthier brand of chips that has about 60% the amount of calories than Doritos, but they end up eating more of it!</strong> Because they know it&#39;s technically healthier and less calorie dense, in their mind, they can eat more of it without feeling guilty. At the end of the day, you&#39;re still going to consume a crazy amount of calories. </p>

Evaluation of the deleterious health effects of consumption of repeatedly heated vegetable oil

Abstract

Consumption of repeatedly heated cooking oil (RHCO) has been a regular practice without knowing the harmful effects of use. The present study is based on the hypothesis that, heating of edible oils to their boiling points results in the formation of free radicals that cause oxidative stress and induce damage at the cellular and molecular levels. Peroxide value of heated oil, histopathological alterations, antioxidant enzyme levels and blood biochemistry were determined in Wistar rats treated with the RHCO. RHCO revealed higher peroxide value in comparison to oil that has been unheated or singly heated. Histopathological observation depicted significant damage in jejunum, colon and liver of animals that received oil heated repeatedly for 3 times. The altered antioxidant status reflects an adaptive response to oxidative stress. Alteration in the levels of these enzymes might be due to the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) through auto oxidation or enzyme catalyzed oxidation of electrophilic components within RHCO. Analysis of blood samples revealed elevated levels of glucose, creatinine and cholesterol with declined levels of protein and albumin in repeatedly heated cooking oil group. Hematological parameters did not reveal any statistically significant difference between treated and control groups. Results of the present study confirm that the thermal oxidation of cooking oil generates free radicals and dietary consumption of such oil results in detrimental health effects.",t2_6m2x7,False,,0,False,"Consumption of repeatedly heated vegetable oil by rates caused ""significant damage"" in the small intestines, colon and liver.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3448089/

The influence of diet on the composition of the microbiota has been shown during the initial colonization phase: breast fed infants have higher levels of Bifidobacteria spp. while formula fed infants have higher levels of Bacteroides spp., as well as increased Clostridium coccoides and Lactobacillus spp. [44]. Beyond the postnatal period, the microbiota was suspected to be relatively stable throughout life.

 However, several recent studies have shown that dietary factors alter the microbial community resulting in biological changes to the host (Table 1). In fact, the composition of the gut microbiota strongly correlates with diet as demonstrated by a study assessing the relative contributions of host genetics and diet in shaping the gut microbiota and modulating metabolic syndrome phenotypes in mice. In mice fed a diet high in fat, there are many key gut population changes, such as the absence of gut barrier-protecting Bifidobacteria spp. 

Overall, dietary changes could explain 57% of the total structural variation in gut microbiota whereas changes in genetics accounted for no more than 12% [45]. 

**This indicates that diet has a dominating role in shaping gut microbiota** and changing key populations may transform healthy gut microbiota into a disease-inducing entity. For example, the “Western” diet, which is high in sugar and fat, causes dysbiosis which affects both host GI tract metabolism and immune homeostasis [46]. This was modeled in a humanized mouse model where adult human fecal microbiota was transplanted into GF mice. The mice were fed a low-fat, plant polysaccharide-rich diet and when switched to a “Western” diet, the microbiota composition shifted to an overgrowth of Firmicutes including Clostridium innocuum, Eubacterium dolichum, Catenibacterium mitsuokai and Enterococcus spp., as well as a significant reduction in several Bacteroides spp. [18]. In mice, carbohydrate-reduced diets result in enriched populations of bacteria from the Bacteroidetes phyla, [47] and calorie-restricted diets prevent the growth of Clostridium coccoides, Lactobacillus spp. and Bifidobacteria spp., which are all major butyrate producers required for colonocyte homeostasis [48]. Diets rich in complex carbohydrates show less pathogenic species such as Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis and Enterobacteriaceae [49] than diets higher in fat or protein [48,50,51,52]. 

Complex carbohydrates also increase levels of beneficial Bifidobacteria spp. such as B. longum subspecies longum, B. breve and B. thetaiotaomicron [53]. **Refined sugars, on the other hand, mediate the overgrowth of opportunistic bacteria like C. difficile [54] and C. perfringens by increasing bile output** [55].

 Vegetarianism alters intestinal microbiota in humans because high amounts of fiber result in increased short chain fatty acid production by microbes which decrease the intestinal pH. This prevents the growth of potentially pathogenic bacteria such as E. coli and other members of Enterobacteriaceae [56]. 

Interestingly, it has been found that European children have a microbiota depleted of Bacteroidetes and enriched in Enterobacteriaceae compared to rural African children which the authors attributed to low dietary fiber intake by Europeans",t2_6m2x7,False,,0,False,"Overall, dietary changes could explain 57% of the total structural variation in gut microbiota whereas changes in genetics accounted for no more than 12%.

<p><strong>This indicates that diet has a dominating role in shaping gut microbiota</strong> and changing key populations may transform healthy gut microbiota into a disease-inducing entity. For example, the “Western” diet, which is high in sugar and fat, causes dysbiosis which affects both host GI tract metabolism and immune homeostasis [46]. This was modeled in a humanized mouse model where adult human fecal microbiota was transplanted into GF mice. The mice were fed a low-fat, plant polysaccharide-rich diet and when switched to a “Western” diet, the microbiota composition shifted to an overgrowth of Firmicutes including Clostridium innocuum, Eubacterium dolichum, Catenibacterium mitsuokai and Enterococcus spp., as well as a significant reduction in several Bacteroides spp. [18]. In mice, carbohydrate-reduced diets result in enriched populations of bacteria from the Bacteroidetes phyla, [47] and calorie-restricted diets prevent the growth of Clostridium coccoides, Lactobacillus spp. and Bifidobacteria spp., which are all major butyrate producers required for colonocyte homeostasis [48]. Diets rich in complex carbohydrates show less pathogenic species such as Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis and Enterobacteriaceae [49] than diets higher in fat or protein [48,50,51,52]. </p>

<p>Complex carbohydrates also increase levels of beneficial Bifidobacteria spp. such as B. longum subspecies longum, B. breve and B. thetaiotaomicron [53]. <strong>Refined sugars, on the other hand, mediate the overgrowth of opportunistic bacteria like C. difficile [54] and C. perfringens by increasing bile output</strong> [55].</p>

<p>Vegetarianism alters intestinal microbiota in humans because high amounts of fiber result in increased short chain fatty acid production by microbes which decrease the intestinal pH. This prevents the growth of potentially pathogenic bacteria such as E. coli and other members of Enterobacteriaceae [56]. </p>

<p>Interestingly, it has been found that European children have a microbiota depleted of Bacteroidetes and enriched in Enterobacteriaceae compared to rural African children which the authors attributed to low dietary fiber intake by Europeans</p>

So there's that. But for the microbiome they are incredible. First understand how important Resistant starch is for the microbiome.

https://www.dermveda.com/articles/why-you-should-eat-resistant-starch-for-a-healthy-microbiome

>Resistant starch is metabolized by microbes in the gut to produce molecules called short chain fatty acids, such as acetate, butyrate and propionate. These short chain fatty acids have significant health benefits, including cancer fighting benefits and anti-inflammatory effects.[4,5] Diets high in resistant starch lead to higher levels of short chain fatty acids and may offer protection against colon inflammation and disease.[6] The dietary fiber that is fermented by our gut microorganisms are referred to as “prebiotics,” leading to the production of beneficial short chain fatty acids and other molecules, including serotonin and deoxycholic acid.[7,8]

>Eating resistant starch may even improve problems with insulin regulation, including insulin resistance and diabetes.[9]

>In addition, RS (resistant starch) has specific beneficial effects on the gut environment including increased populations of Ruminococcus bromii -a dominant member of the phylum Firmicutes that plays a primary role in releasing energy from dietary starches that escape digestion by host enzymes through its exceptional activity against particulate resistant starches. Besides this, ingestion of food products rich in RS has been shown to increase luminal short-chain fatty acid levels, modulate microbial metabolism and improve markers of glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity

>Regarding cell signalling pathways that can explain physiological effects of RS, using animal models it has been well documented that **resistant starch has strong anti-inflammatory properties**

And beans are far and away the best source of resistant starch in our diets. They have many more times the RS as any other commonly eaten food. See here for more.

In order to research the effects of processed foods, it's obviously important to have a well-defined definition for what is or isn't a processed food.

A very common definition used in a lot of research is the NOVA food classification:

https://educhange.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NOVA-Classification-Reference-Sheet.pdf

In short, it breaks up all foods into 4 groups:

GROUP 1: UNPROCESSED OR MINIMALLY PROCESSED FOODS

GROUP 2: OILS, FATS, SALT, AND SUGAR

GROUP 3: PROCESSED FOODS

GROUP 4: ULTRA-PROCESSED FOODS

There are often foods that at first glance might not obviously fall into any specific category, but the examples generally put most foods very specifically in one category.

E.g. you might think that dried pasta should be group three processed, but it is considered group 1: minimally processed, while homemade bread is considered group 3: processed. 

It might not be a perfect definition, but it provides a common framework from which we can work. Generally when you read about scientific studies talking about the effects of processed foods, they are referring to NOVA classifications:

e.g. I just grabbed some of these of google scholar:

The idea that you should not take creatine and caffeine together as creatine causes water retention while caffeine causes water loss. In other words, the two supplements cancel each other out.

I wanted to address this for anyone confused about this. Quick rundown of my creds: Bachelor's degree in Human Kinetics, certified with International Sports Science Association as a fitness trainer, nutrition coach and S&C coach. 5 years experience as a personal trainer. Avid reader of scientific literature in the realm of sports medicine. Lover of both coffee and creatine :)

Firstly, I would like to mention something often overlooked in the explanation for why these two supplements oppose each other; water manipulation is neither the main function of creatine, nor caffeine. At least in the way people primarily use these supplements.

Creatine increases creatine phosphate stores in the muscles, improving athletic performance, particularly in short bouts of high-intensity effort. Caffeine blocks adenosine receptors (our ""tiredness"" receptors) improving energy levels, focus and overall athletic performance. With these functions in mind, it is clear that these two supplements do not antagonise, but rather synergise to improve athletic performance.

Lastly, the water changes associated with creatine and caffeine are fairly negligible. Furthermore, there are very few contexts where one would use these supplements specifically for their water manipulation effects. One would be the use of caffeine to cause water loss for a weight-class athlete to 'make weight'. Another would be a bodybuilder hoping to use creatine's water retention to 'puff up'. (Not that it would make much difference since the maximum water retention throughout the body from creatine use appears to be around 2lbs).

These magazines and so-called experts neglect to address these very specific contexts and instead treat them as the rule, rather than the exception. (I believe this is just for the sake of being controversial and edgy, but that's a discussion for another day).

Basically, my wife and I are doing a BlueApron/HomeChef meal planning, but we're doing it with a couple of apps.  The best part about it is that we're not shipping food across the country, we're buying it from our local grocery stores -- yet still having it delivered to our house.

It involves two apps (note: I am not affiliated with either of these apps)

* [Mealime](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mealime-meal-plans-recipes/id1079999103?mt=8)  — this is a great recipe app; it allows you to schedule your meals,  filter recipes on your personal food preferences -- you can specify low carb, keto, paleo, vegetarian, flexitarian, etc -- you can even list ingredients you don't like or are allergic to.  The recipes are all high quality, beautifully photographed, and easy to read.  Most importantly, it lets you  upload your shopping list to Instacart, which brings me to the second  app.
* [Instacart](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/instacart/id545599256?mt=8) — order groceries from local grocery stores and *have them delivered the same day*.   So, instead of picking out meals and shipping your groceries from  across the country, you’re just ordering from stores you probably  already shop.  I believe there’s either a delivery fee, or you can sign  up for $99/year (in which case any order over $35 is free).  Either way, it’s probably cheaper than any of the home  chef options out there.

So, when we plan our meals for the week, it all goes into Instacart.  Then we take out the stuff we have already, and hit the order button.  It usually arrives at our door in an hour or two.  Much cheaper, more convenient, and quicker than other meal prep services.

Broccoli is found to be a good source of glucosinolates, which can be hydrolyzed by endogenous myrosinase to obtain chemopreventive isothiocyanates (ITCs); among them, sulforaphane (SF) is the most important agent. Studies have shown that cooking greatly affects the levels of SF and total ITCs in broccoli. However, the stability of these compounds during cooking has been infrequently examined. In this study, we proved that the half-lives of SF and total ITCs during stir-frying were 7.7 and 5.9 min, respectively, while the myrosinase activity decreased by 80% after stir-frying for 3 min; SF and total ITCs were more stable than myrosinase. Thus, the contents of SF and total ITCs decreased during stir-frying largely because myrosinase was destroyed. Subsequently, it was confirmed that compared to direct stir-frying, hydrolysis of glucosinolates in broccoli for 90 min followed by stir-frying increased the SF and total ITC concentration by 2.8 and 2.6 times, respectively. This method provides large quantities of beneficial ITCs even after cooking.

It makes it easier, especially for those who have diet restrictions, on a huge bulk or lack the time or ability to cook. But what I'm referring to is the image of the protein shake that is sold on to the public. The idea that you grab a protein shake, do your workout and scuff it down as fast as you can in fear of losing the hard earned gains you just made is proliferated with every novice gym-goer (myself included). When anyone starts a fitness regime, they buy protein powder in bulk. It's almost seen as a necessity to building muscle.

But if you do some research on nutrient timing, daily nutrition etc, anyone can easily see that to a general extent the timing of your food intake does not matter except maybe having some carbs in you in the few hours before or after a workout; protein-wise, it doesn't seem to make a difference. This throws the necessity of the protein shake completely out the window. Even the idea of needing a shake bottle makes no sense - you can just go home and stir it in a glass and drink and don't need to leave a gross unwashed bottle with a foul smell in the sink for days. The 20g of protein per scoop is such a minuscule amount if you compare it to just cooking the extra amount when you make your meals.

So for the basic gym go-er, why is the protein shake seen as such a necessity?

2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x0000025A147D1460>,,nutrition,"I've noticed that most diets and nutritional regimens out there just try to fix the damage that's already done by excessive weight or obesity, either by trying to cause the weight loss through calorie deficit, or by trying to undo health damage through healthier food choices. But few of them are concerned about very long term eating patterns one needs to have in order to be and stay healthy and within healthy weight range.

I also feel there's been too few studies about eating habits of healthy, normal weight people... also too few studies about how the typical eating habits of overweight and obese people differ from eating habits of healthy, normal weight people.

In my opinion instead of trying to make short term fix by undoing the damage that has already been caused by overweight and obesity, it would be much wiser to try and see how we can make long term modifications to eating habits of overweight and obese people to make their eating habits more alike eating habits of healthy people.

So my hypothesis is that if overweight and obese people simply copied the eating habits of healthy, normal weight people, that would be enough to rid them of their obesity permanently and in long term. So there's no need for much philosophy... simply eat what healthy people already eat, and you're on your way to become like them. The extra weight wouldn't go overnight... It might take a couple of years until the body adapts to a new eating pattern and until the weight stabilizes on a new, healthier level. So the lack of immediate results would be discouraging to many. But I really believe this is the only way to a long term solution.

It's interesting to note that sometimes people make such kind of dietary changes unintentionally... It can be the result of moving to another country that has healthier eating patterns, or simply marrying a spouse who has different habits when it comes to food.

But few of them are concerned about very long term eating patterns one needs to have in order to be and stay healthy and within healthy weight range.</p>

<p>I also feel there&#39;s been too few studies about eating habits of healthy, normal weight people... also too few studies about how the typical eating habits of overweight and obese people differ from eating habits of healthy, normal weight people.</p>

<p>In my opinion instead of trying to make short term fix by undoing the damage that has already been caused by overweight and obesity, it would be much wiser to try and see how we can make long term modifications to eating habits of overweight and obese people to make their eating habits more alike eating habits of healthy people.</p>

<p>So my hypothesis is that if overweight and obese people simply copied the eating habits of healthy, normal weight people, that would be enough to rid them of their obesity permanently and in long term. So there&#39;s no need for much philosophy... simply eat what healthy people already eat, and you&#39;re on your way to become like them. The extra weight wouldn&#39;t go overnight... It might take a couple of years until the body adapts to a new eating pattern and until the weight stabilizes on a new, healthier level. So the lack of immediate results would be discouraging to many. But I really believe this is the only way to a long term solution.</p>

<p>It&#39;s interesting to note that sometimes people make such kind of dietary changes unintentionally... It can be the result of moving to another country that has healthier eating patterns, or simply marrying a spouse who has different habits when it comes to food. Simply adapting your eating habits to such a new environment could in long term lead to a sustainable weight loss... At least that&#39;s what I believe...</p>

Spinach has all the Vitamin A,C,K,Calcium, Magnesium. And nutritional yeast has all the B vitamins, zinc. You are supposed to have the yeast with food. And it would give the spinach a nutty/cheese flavour to make it more interesting. They complement each other perfectly.

You still would be missing 60% of vitamin E, all your Vitamin D (hard to get from food - but sardines will work), 40% of your zinc and iron and B2, 33% your magnesium and Phosphorus, Potassium and Copper. Though you can use 2 teaspoons of yeast flakes to solve half of that. However you cant really get much more iron/calcium/zinc/magnesium from this meal anyway as your body can only absorb 700mg of those at once and you are reaching that limit with this meal.

But if you eat this you are pretty much covered since you have another 1900 calories left to get the 10% of things still left. This should fit into any diet. In fact despite being totally carbs this is even keto compliant - as leafy greens at or below 5% of total calories is allowed. It will work with ultra-low calorie diets like 500 calorie OMAD. It will work with putting on muscle while losing fat (when you need to eat 150g in 1500 calories, which is tough).


Both things store for a long time and take minimal preparation. It costs less than £1. Its also 40% of your fibre. Microwave it or sautee it in butter with garlic and lemon or cumin and garam masla. Then sprinkle yeast flakes at end.

When you are reading a paper that is not in your area of expertise, it's hard to see or judge its relevance. Specifically about nutrition, people will tend to read and comment on epidemiological studies, because those are easy to understand. But in doing so, we may be under the impression that scientists know less than they do.

For example, in a recent post about processed meats, many people claimed that the evidence against processed meats was purely based on correlation rather than causation. You may conclude this if you only look at epidemiological studies with human participants, but they are not the only types of studies that have been performed.

When one looks into studies about, for instance, cancer and processed meats, we need to keep in mind that many relevant studies will not be obvious. For example, this is a completely non-sensical made-up title, mind you: ""Aminoacids react with nitrate and cause activation of the GPJY-3 pathway in colonocytes in rats."" This study will probably never be discussed here, but let's assume that it actually shows how a compound found in processed meats cause activation of some metabolic and genetic pathways linked to cancer in the colon. But because you don't understand it, you'll ignore it.

We all have a tendency to ignore what we don't understand, and in nutrition it might lead to wrong conclusions.

He recommends <em>increasing</em> protein intake, especially as one gets older, since frailty is as great a risk as any other morbidity. Attia also seems to think the the apparent link between animal protein and disease is not justified by the data.</p>

<p>What are your thoughts on the alleged risks of a high protein diet vs the alleged risks of a low protein diet? Is there a sweet spot of enough protein to build and maintain muscle and strength while still minimizing risk of cancer? Is either one of these opposing recommendations faulty?</p>

And yet the evidence linking bacon to cancer is stronger than ever. In January, **a new large-scale study using data from 262,195 British women suggested that consuming just 9g of bacon a day – less than a rasher – could significantly raise the risk of developing breast cancer later in life. The study’s lead author, Jill Pell from the Institute of Health and Wellbei**ng at Glasgow University, told me that while it can be counterproductive to push for total abstinence, the scientific evidence suggests “it would be misleading” for health authorities to set any safe dose for processed meat “other than zero”.

The real scandal of bacon, however, is that it didn’t have to be anything like so damaging to our health. **The part of the story we haven’t been told – including by the WHO – is that there were always other ways to manufacture these products that would make them significantly less carcinogenic**. The fact that this is so little known is tribute to the power of the meat industry, which has for the past 40 years been engaged in a campaign of cover-ups and misdirection to rival the dirty tricks of Big Tobacco.

“Pure insane crazy madness” is how Coudray described the continuing use of nitrates and nitrites in processed meats, in an email to me. The madness, in his view, is that it is possible to make bacon and ham in ways that would be less carcinogenic. The most basic way to cure any meat is to salt it – either with a dry salt rub or a wet brine – and to wait for time to do the rest. Coudray notes that ham and bacon manufacturers claim this old-fashioned way of curing isn’t safe. But the real reason they reject it is cost: it takes much longer for processed meats to develop their flavour this way, which cuts into profits.

Many people routinely take nutritional supplements such as vitamin D and fish oil in the hopes of staving off major killers like cancer and heart disease.

But the evidence about the possible benefits of the supplements has been mixed.

Now, long-awaited government-funded research has produced some of the clearest evidence yet about the usefulness of taking the supplements. And the results — published in two papers — are mostly disappointing.

""Both trials were negative,"" says Dr. Lawrence Fine, chief of the clinical application and prevention branch of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, a part of the National Institutes of Health, which funded the studies.

""Overall, they showed that neither fish oil nor vitamin D actually lowered the incidence of heart disease or cancer,"" Fine says.

The results were presented at the American Heart Association Scientific Sessions in Chicago and released online Saturday by The New England Journal of Medicine. One paper focused on vitamin D supplementation, and the other focused on fish oil.

The trials involved nearly 26,000 healthy adults age 50 and older with no history of cancer or heart disease who took part in the VITAL research project. Twenty percent of the participants were African-American.

Abstract

Objectives: This study addressed whether food and nutrient intakes were correlated with skin wrinkling in a sun-exposed site.

Methods: 177 Greek-born subjects living in Melbourne (GRM), 69 Greek subjects living in rural Greece (GRG), 48 Anglo-Celtic Australian (ACA) elderly living in Melbourne and 159 Swedish subjects living in Sweden (SWE) participating in the International Union of Nutritional Sciences IUNS [Food Habits in Later Lifersqb; study had their dietary intakes measured and their skin assessed. Food and nutrient intakes were assessed using a validated semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Skin wrinkling was measured using a cutaneous microtopographic method.

Results: SWE elderly had the least skin wrinkling in a sun-exposed site, followed by GRM, GRG and ACA. Correlation analyses on the pooled data and using the major food groups suggested that there may be less actinic skin damage with a higher intake of vegetables (rs=−0.31, p<0.0001), olive oil (rs=−0.29, p<0.0001), fish (rs=−0.24, p<0.0001) and legumes (rs=−0.16, p<0.0001), and lower intakes of butter (rs=0.46, p<0.0001) and margarine (rs=0.24, p<0.001), milk products (rs=0.16, p<0.01) and sugar products (rs=0.12, p<0.01). Similar findings were obtained using regression analyses, except fish was no longer significant; 32% of the variance for actinic skin damage was predicted by six out of the ten major food groups. In particular, a high intake of vegetables, legumes and olive oil appeared to be protective against cutaneous actinic damage (collectively explaining 20% of the variance); a high intake of meat, dairy and butter appeared to be adverse (explaining <5% of the variance). Prunes, apples and tea explained 34% of variance amongst ACA.

Not that eating processed foods is healthier than fresh, but at least it could be healthier than it is now.  Is it the expense of the vitamins?  Would it somehow change the taste of their well established brand?  Or they are not allowed to for what ever reason?  Thank you.

Edit: I appreciate everyone's replies.  Just to avoid any more confusion, I do not pretend adding vitamins to unhealthy food, magically makes them healthy food.  But vitamins do make them more healthier than they otherwise would be.  There are also food deserts, many actually, in the US where the choice of healthy foods are quite limited, if offered at all for miles in any one direction, with or with out car or (safe) mass transit.  Check out HBO Docs The Weight of the Nation Poverty and Obesity.

And of course even health conscious people who have poor planning one day or had something come up last minute and they are out the door empty handed.  They will get something from the snack machine regardless.  At least they got something more healthy than without the vitamins.

One way or the other the snacks will be eaten for better or for worse.  But at least they could be healthier than they presently are.

If in the case of maybe eyes will skim and see D and assume it is in it, than why not other vitamins showing 0?

Abstract
Objective To examine the associations between the regular consumption of spicy foods and total and cause specific mortality.

Design Population based prospective cohort study.

Setting China Kadoorie Biobank in which participants from 10 geographically diverse areas across China were enrolled between 2004 and 2008.

Participants 199 293 men and 288 082 women aged 30 to 79 years at baseline after excluding participants with cancer, heart disease, and stroke at baseline.

Main exposure measures Consumption frequency of spicy foods, self reported once at baseline.

Main outcome measures Total and cause specific mortality.

Results During 3 500 004 person years of follow-up between 2004 and 2013 (median 7.2 years), a total of 11 820 men and 8404 women died. Absolute mortality rates according to spicy food consumption categories were 6.1, 4.4, 4.3, and 5.8 deaths per 1000 person years for participants who ate spicy foods less than once a week, 1 or 2, 3 to 5, and 6 or 7 days a week, respectively. **Spicy food consumption showed highly consistent inverse associations with total mortality among both men and women after adjustment for other known or potential risk factors.** In the whole cohort, compared with those who ate spicy foods less than once a week, the adjusted hazard ratios for death were 0.90 (95% confidence interval 0.84 to 0.96), 0.86 (0.80 to 0.92), and 0.86 (0.82 to 0.90) for those who ate spicy food 1 or 2, 3 to 5, and 6 or 7 days a week, respectively. **Compared with those who ate spicy foods less than once a week, those who consumed spicy foods 6 or 7 days a week showed a 14% relative risk reduction in total mortality.** The inverse association between spicy food consumption and total mortality was stronger in those who did not consume alcohol than those who did (P=0.033 for interaction). Inverse associations were also observed for deaths due to cancer, ischemic heart diseases, and respiratory diseases.

-

A year ago, I was all aboard the Keto bandwagon. I had no trouble finding papers and books to support the idea that this type of diet was healthy. All of this information seemed to advocate the idea that as long as you hit your macros, where you got these macros from didn’t matter. Humans were meant to eat high-fat diets, the type of fat didn’t matter.  Eating high-fat, low carb will reduce your risk of stroke, heart-attack, and cancer AND help you lose weight!  I read my keto propaganda and was ensured that I was making the best possible decision for my health. 

I’ve recently become veg for ethical reasons. In the process of doing so, I researched the potential health implications of this. Naturally, I have been able to find papers and books on plant-based diets saying that a whole foods, plant-based diet is the best diet for a person. Eating a whole foods, plant-based diet will reduce your risk of stroke, heart-attack, and cancer AND help you lose weight!  Now I’m reading my veg propaganda and I am ensured I am making the best possible decision for my health. 

If I venture over to pure carnivore/zero-carb websites, they also cite studies to back up the fact that eating all animal-based products is the healthiest thing you can do. 

I guess what I am asking is... why is it so hard for the scientific community to find consensus on the relationship between diet (as well as eating patterns - I’m curious about fasting as well) and health? 

Also, what are some of the best papers/studies on the subject? I’m looking for large-scale, repeatable, peer-reviewed, not funded by special interest groups, etc.  And I am more curious about connection with diet and health, not diet and weight loss.

https://www.reddit.com/r/ScientificNutrition/comments/h9wzzh/potential_adverse_public_health_effects_afforded/

The article is here: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7254282/

>**Abstract:** Exposure of polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)-rich culinary oils (COs) to high temperature frying practices generates high concentrations of cytotoxic and genotoxic lipid oxidation products (LOPs) via oxygen-fueled, recycling peroxidative bursts. These toxins, including aldehydes and epoxy-fatty acids, readily penetrate into fried foods and hence are available for human consumption; therefore, they may pose substantial health hazards. Although previous reports have claimed health benefits offered by the use of PUFA-laden COs for frying purposes, these may be erroneous in view of their failure to consider the negating adverse public health threats presented by food-transferable LOPs therein. When absorbed from the gastrointestinal (GI) system into the systemic circulation, such LOPs may significantly contribute to enhanced risks of chronic non-communicable diseases (NCDs), e.g. , cancer, along with cardiovascular and neurological diseases. Herein, we provide a comprehensive rationale relating to the public health threats posed by the dietary ingestion of LOPs in fried foods. We begin with an introduction to sequential lipid peroxidation processes, describing the noxious effects of LOP toxins generated therefrom. We continue to discuss GI system interactions, the metabolism and biotransformation of primary lipid hydroperoxide LOPs and their secondary products, and the toxicological properties of these agents, prior to providing a narrative on chemically-reactive, secondary aldehydic LOPs available for human ingestion. In view of a range of previous studies focused on their deleterious health effects in animal and cellular model systems, some emphasis is placed on the physiological fate of the more prevalent and toxic α,β-unsaturated aldehydes. We conclude with a description of targeted nutritional and interventional strategies, whilst highlighting the urgent and unmet clinical need for nutritional and epidemiological trials probing relationships between the incidence of NCDs, and the frequency and estimated quantities of dietary LOP intake.

TL;DR: This is a very large review of the evidence of frying oil degradation.

The practical conclusions are that polyunsaturated fats (PUFAs, omega 6 + omega 3), which are a large component of most vegetable oils, are the most reactive and unstable, producing ""lipid oxidation products"" including ""toxic aldehydes"", which have good evidence for being a major source of harm in the average diet. 

Thus, these oils really shouldn't be used for for deepfrying. Better choices would be ones that have low PUFA content, meaning high monounsaturated (olive, avocado, hi-oleic safflower) or high saturated (coconut, tallow). Oils degrade according to 4 factors: PUFA%, antioxidant/polyphenol content, temperature and time.  Smoke point doesn't appear to correlate with those parameters at all, so shouldn't be the primary way oils are judged.

<p>The article is here: <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7254282/"">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7254282/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Exposure of polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)-rich culinary oils (COs) to high temperature frying practices generates high concentrations of cytotoxic and genotoxic lipid oxidation products (LOPs) via oxygen-fueled, recycling peroxidative bursts. These toxins, including aldehydes and epoxy-fatty acids, readily penetrate into fried foods and hence are available for human consumption; therefore, they may pose substantial health hazards. Although previous reports have claimed health benefits offered by the use of PUFA-laden COs for frying purposes, these may be erroneous in view of their failure to consider the negating adverse public health threats presented by food-transferable LOPs therein. When absorbed from the gastrointestinal (GI) system into the systemic circulation, such LOPs may significantly contribute to enhanced risks of chronic non-communicable diseases (NCDs), e.g. , cancer, along with cardiovascular and neurological diseases. Herein, we provide a comprehensive rationale relating to the public health threats posed by the dietary ingestion of LOPs in fried foods. We begin with an introduction to sequential lipid peroxidation processes, describing the noxious effects of LOP toxins generated therefrom. We continue to discuss GI system interactions, the metabolism and biotransformation of primary lipid hydroperoxide LOPs and their secondary products, and the toxicological properties of these agents, prior to providing a narrative on chemically-reactive, secondary aldehydic LOPs available for human ingestion. In view of a range of previous studies focused on their deleterious health effects in animal and cellular model systems, some emphasis is placed on the physiological fate of the more prevalent and toxic α,β-unsaturated aldehydes. We conclude with a description of targeted nutritional and interventional strategies, whilst highlighting the urgent and unmet clinical need for nutritional and epidemiological trials probing relationships between the incidence of NCDs, and the frequency and estimated quantities of dietary LOP intake.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>TL;DR: This is a very large review of the evidence of frying oil degradation.</p>

<p>The practical conclusions are that polyunsaturated fats (PUFAs, omega 6 + omega 3), which are a large component of most vegetable oils, are the most reactive and unstable, producing &quot;lipid oxidation products&quot; including &quot;toxic aldehydes&quot;, which have good evidence for being a major source of harm in the average diet. </p>

<p>Thus, these oils really shouldn&#39;t be used for for deepfrying. Better choices would be ones that have low PUFA content, meaning high monounsaturated (olive, avocado, hi-oleic safflower) or high saturated (coconut, tallow). Oils degrade according to 4 factors: PUFA%, antioxidant/polyphenol content, temperature and time.  Smoke point doesn&#39;t appear to correlate with those parameters at all, so shouldn&#39;t be the primary way oils are judged.</p>

<p>Many nutrition authorities recommend eating more polyunsaturated fat vegetable oils because they lower cholesterol, however according to this new evidence, that really shouldn&#39;t apply to deep fryers!</p>

<p>This means that fries and nuggets and chips aren&#39;t just &quot;high fat/calorie dense&quot; or &quot;processed&quot; or &quot;have too much salt&quot;, they are actually quite harmful for an additional reason that is underappreciated.</p>

Do you think most of us operate in the middle or closer to one or the other extreme? </p>

<p>Note, when I say ‘doing well,’ I mean functioning well and not necessarily looking good. It doesn’t mean much if you have no stomach fat but you’re bloated and constipated all the time, nor if you’re at your goal weight but have no energy to function.</p>

Ok, to the extent that diet is a factor, lets consider Hong Kong diet.

In no particular order.
Cantonese are more rice focused than average Chinese.  Canton/Vietnam is around where rice waa originally domesticated and it shows.  Every meal has A pot of white boiled rice available.

Hong Kong is very Haute about variety of meats.  A typical family breakfast or dinner has as many dishes as people at table.   2 legs, 4 legs, no legs.  It means a meal has a bird (2 legs) dish, a pork/beef dish and a fish dish.   

No dairy, but plenty of broth.  Weird and wonderful mixtures that mums force their kida to drink.  It called tong. 

Fresh green vegies, historically china could be in famine, and canton would still be lush with food, its an extraordinary fertile region.  Lots of fresh chinese greens.  Again there is a profound focus on fresh.

Everything is cooked,  unlike the Vietnamese, Cantonese consider salad to be stir fry ingredients.  Raw food is considered risky (unclean).  (Unless it a thick skin fruit like a mandarin etc).  They dont do raw juice.

They live fast, cook fast, but eat slow.  Food is meant to be tasted, savoured.

Many people might think of soil as just dirt, but it's actually a complex ecosystem that supports plant growth and is home to countless microorganisms. In fact, one teaspoon of soil can contain more microorganisms than there are people on Earth!

But soil is not just important for plants and microorganisms. It's also crucial for our food production. Without healthy soil, we wouldn't be able to grow nutritious fruits and vegetables or raise healthy livestock. In other words, our food supply would be greatly diminished without healthy soil.

Aside from its role in food production, soil also plays a key role in our environment. It helps to filter and clean our water, reduce air pollution, and regulate climate. Soil also acts as a natural carbon sink, storing carbon dioxide and helping to combat climate change.

So as we celebrate World Soil Day, let's remember the many ways that soil supports our daily lives. And let's take action to protect and preserve our soil for future generations.

Apparently the disease is caused by chickens not being able to handle their own weight. So, the muscles are replaced with fat. This also mainly targets chicken breast according to the news articles. 

The news also says this disease is not dangerous for humans (or even the chicken themselves). 

But, if there’s now more fat in chicken breast than there was 10 years ago, shouldn’t there be some kind of public service announcement saying “chicken breast now has X grams of fat per 100 grams”?

Personally i would split the dinner into two smaller meals

If there is interest, i could make a downloadable copy for people to input their own daily needs of nutrition (usually the biggest factor is age/gender/weight) and be able to work out a food plan that suits their tastes/needs.

An international team of scientists have confirmed the discovery of a major cause of dementia, with important implications for possible treatment and diagnosis.

Professor Garth Cooper from The University of Manchester, who leads the Manchester team, says the build-up of urea in the brain to toxic levels can cause brain damage – and eventually dementia.

The work follows on from Professor Cooper’s earlier studies, which identified metabolic linkages between Huntington’s, other neurodegenerative diseases and type-2 diabetes.

The team consists of scientists from The University of Manchester, the University of Auckland, AgResearch New Zealand, the South Australian Research and Development Institute, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard University.

The latest paper by the scientists, published today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, shows that Huntington’s Disease – one of seven major types of age-related dementia – is directly linked to brain urea levels and metabolic processes.

1. **Ashwagandha** \- If I pop a gram of these slightly after midday, my sleep quality that night will be markedly improved and I'll feel much more rested the next day (causes some weird dreams though). Ash lowers cortisol. It's my belief that this may be what's contributing to my improved sleep quality.
2. **L-Theanine -** Taking this an hour before bed, or straight before going asleep, seems to give me a much deeper sleep. So much so, that sometimes it's difficult to get up! L-theanine is an amino acid found in tea which is said to increase alpha brainwave activity. It's possible this may be what is improving my sleep(?)

A shout out to two other candidates, which don't necessarily improve my sleep *quality*, but help me fall asleep easier:

**Magnesium glycinate** \- If I pop one of these, I usually fall asleep within 30 minutes. Again, similar to Ash, it causes some weird-ass dreams though.

**Bananas** \- Similar to the above minus the weird-ass dreams. Bananas help produce melatonin (the chemical that gets released when you sleep), and the sugar in them makes you crash within 30-45 minutes, (usually) leaving you feel tired and ready for sleep.

<ol>
<li><strong>Ashwagandha</strong> - If I pop a gram of these slightly after midday, my sleep quality that night will be markedly improved and I&#39;ll feel much more rested the next day (causes some weird dreams though). Ash lowers cortisol. It&#39;s my belief that this may be what&#39;s contributing to my improved sleep quality.</li>
<li><strong>L-Theanine -</strong> Taking this an hour before bed, or straight before going asleep, seems to give me a much deeper sleep. So much so, that sometimes it&#39;s difficult to get up! L-theanine is an amino acid found in tea which is said to increase alpha brainwave activity. It&#39;s possible this may be what is improving my sleep(?)</li>
</ol>

<p>A shout out to two other candidates, which don&#39;t necessarily improve my sleep <em>quality</em>, but help me fall asleep easier:</p>

<p><strong>Magnesium glycinate</strong> - If I pop one of these, I usually fall asleep within 30 minutes. Again, similar to Ash, it causes some weird-ass dreams though.</p>

<p><strong>Bananas</strong> - Similar to the above minus the weird-ass dreams. Bananas help produce melatonin (the chemical that gets released when you sleep), and the sugar in them makes you crash within 30-45 minutes, (usually) leaving you feel tired and ready for sleep.</p>

<p>My question to you guys is, which foods seem to improve (your) sleep quality? Anecdotal and scientific reports welcomed! :)</p>

<p>EDIT: L-Theanine dose 700-800mg</p>

**Importance**  Although emphasis has recently been placed on the importance of high-protein diets to overall health, a comprehensive analysis of long-term cause-specific mortality in association with the intake of plant protein and animal protein has not been reported.

**Objective**  To examine the associations between overall mortality and cause-specific mortality and plant protein intake.

**Design, Setting, and Participants**  This prospective cohort study analyzed data from 416 104 men and women in the US National Institutes of Health–AARP Diet and Health Study from 1995 to 2011. Data were analyzed from October 2018 through April 2020.

**Exposures**  Validated baseline food frequency questionnaire dietary information, including intake of plant protein and animal protein.

**Main Outcomes and Measures**  Hazard ratios and 16-year absolute risk differences for overall mortality and cause-specific mortality.

**Results**  The final analytic cohort included 237 036 men (57%) and 179 068 women. Their overall median (SD) ages were 62.2 (5.4) years for men and 62.0 (5.4) years for women. Based on 6 009 748 person-years of observation, 77 614 deaths (18.7%; 49 297 men and 28 317 women) were analyzed. Adjusting for several important clinical and other risk factors, greater dietary plant protein intake was associated with reduced overall mortality in both sexes (hazard ratio per 1 SD was 0.95 \[95% CI, 0.94-0.97\] for men and 0.95 \[95% CI, 0.93-0.96\] for women; adjusted absolute risk difference per 1 SD was −0.36% \[95% CI, −0.48% to −0.25%\] for men and −0.33% \[95% CI, −0.48% to −0.21%\] for women; hazard ratio per 10 g/1000 kcal was 0.88 \[95% CI, 0.84-0.91\] for men and 0.86 \[95% CI, 0.82-0.90\] for women; adjusted absolute risk difference per 10 g/1000 kcal was −0.95% \[95% CI, −1.3% to −0.68%\] for men and −0.86% \[95% CI, −1.3% to −0.55%\] for women; all *P* < .001). The association between plant protein intake and overall mortality was similar across the subgroups of smoking status, diabetes, fruit consumption, vitamin supplement use, and self-reported health status. **Replacement of 3% energy from animal protein with plant protein was inversely associated with overall mortality (risk decreased 10% in both men and women) and cardiovascular disease mortality (11% lower risk in men and 12% lower risk in women). In particular, the lower overall mortality was attributable primarily to substitution of plant protein for egg protein (24% lower risk in men and 21% lower risk in women) and red meat protein (13% lower risk in men and 15% lower risk in women).**

**Conclusions and Relevance**  In this large prospective cohort, higher plant protein intake was associated with small reductions in risk of overall and cardiovascular disease mortality.

<p><strong>Importance</strong>  Although emphasis has recently been placed on the importance of high-protein diets to overall health, a comprehensive analysis of long-term cause-specific mortality in association with the intake of plant protein and animal protein has not been reported.</p>

<p><strong>Objective</strong>  To examine the associations between overall mortality and cause-specific mortality and plant protein intake.</p>

<p><strong>Design, Setting, and Participants</strong>  This prospective cohort study analyzed data from 416 104 men and women in the US National Institutes of Health–AARP Diet and Health Study from 1995 to 2011. Data were analyzed from October 2018 through April 2020.</p>

<p><strong>Exposures</strong>  Validated baseline food frequency questionnaire dietary information, including intake of plant protein and animal protein.</p>

<p><strong>Main Outcomes and Measures</strong>  Hazard ratios and 16-year absolute risk differences for overall mortality and cause-specific mortality.</p>

<p><strong>Results</strong>  The final analytic cohort included 237 036 men (57%) and 179 068 women. Their overall median (SD) ages were 62.2 (5.4) years for men and 62.0 (5.4) years for women. Based on 6 009 748 person-years of observation, 77 614 deaths (18.7%; 49 297 men and 28 317 women) were analyzed. Adjusting for several important clinical and other risk factors, greater dietary plant protein intake was associated with reduced overall mortality in both sexes (hazard ratio per 1 SD was 0.95 [95% CI, 0.94-0.97] for men and 0.95 [95% CI, 0.93-0.96] for women; adjusted absolute risk difference per 1 SD was −0.36% [95% CI, −0.48% to −0.25%] for men and −0.33% [95% CI, −0.48% to −0.21%] for women; hazard ratio per 10 g/1000 kcal was 0.88 [95% CI, 0.84-0.91] for men and 0.86 [95% CI, 0.82-0.90] for women; adjusted absolute risk difference per 10 g/1000 kcal was −0.95% [95% CI, −1.3% to −0.68%] for men and −0.86% [95% CI, −1.3% to −0.55%] for women; all <em>P</em> &lt; .001). The association between plant protein intake and overall mortality was similar across the subgroups of smoking status, diabetes, fruit consumption, vitamin supplement use, and self-reported health status. <strong>Replacement of 3% energy from animal protein with plant protein was inversely associated with overall mortality (risk decreased 10% in both men and women) and cardiovascular disease mortality (11% lower risk in men and 12% lower risk in women). In particular, the lower overall mortality was attributable primarily to substitution of plant protein for egg protein (24% lower risk in men and 21% lower risk in women) and red meat protein (13% lower risk in men and 15% lower risk in women).</strong></p>

<p><strong>Conclusions and Relevance</strong>  In this large prospective cohort, higher plant protein intake was associated with small reductions in risk of overall and cardiovascular disease mortality. Our findings provide evidence that dietary modification in choice of protein sources may influence health and longevity.</p>

“ Question  What were the trends in carbohydrate, fat, and protein intake among US adults from 1999 to 2016?

Findings  In this nationally representative serial cross-sectional study that included 43 996 adults, there were decreases in low-quality carbohydrates (primarily added sugar) and increases in high-quality carbohydrates (primarily whole grains), plant protein (primarily whole grains and nuts), and polyunsaturated fat. However, 42% of energy intake was still derived from low-quality carbohydrates and the intake of saturated fat remained above 10% of energy.

Meaning  The macronutrient composition of diet among US adults has improved, but continued high intake of low-quality carbohydrates and saturated fat remain.

Abstract
Importance  Changes in the economy, nutrition policies, and food processing methods can affect dietary macronutrient intake and diet quality. It is essential to evaluate trends in dietary intake, food sources, and diet quality to inform policy makers.

Objective  To investigate trends in dietary macronutrient intake, food sources, and diet quality among US adults.

Design, Setting, and Participants  Serial cross-sectional analysis of the US nationally representative 24-hour dietary recall data from 9 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey cycles (1999-2016) among adults aged 20 years or older.

Exposure  Survey cycle.

Main Outcomes and Measures  Dietary intake of macronutrients and their subtypes, food sources, and the Healthy Eating Index 2015 (range, 0-100; higher scores indicate better diet quality; a minimal clinically important difference has not been defined).

Results  There were 43 996 respondents (weighted mean age, 46.9 years; 51.9% women). From 1999 to 2016, the estimated energy from total carbohydrates declined from 52.5% to 50.5% (difference, −2.02%; 95% CI, −2.41% to −1.63%), whereas that of total protein and total fat increased from 15.5% to 16.4% (difference, 0.82%; 95% CI, 0.67%-0.97%) and from 32.0% to 33.2% (difference, 1.20%; 95% CI, 0.84%-1.55%), respectively (all P < .001 for trend). Estimated energy from low-quality carbohydrates decreased by 3.25% (95% CI, 2.74%-3.75%; P < .001 for trend) from 45.1% to 41.8%. Increases were observed in estimated energy from high-quality carbohydrates (by 1.23% [95% CI, 0.84%-1.61%] from 7.42% to 8.65%), plant protein (by 0.38% [95% CI, 0.28%-0.49%] from 5.38% to 5.76%), saturated fatty acids (by 0.36% [95% CI, 0.20%-0.51%] from 11.5% to 11.9%), and polyunsaturated fatty acids (by 0.65% [95% CI, 0.56%-0.74%] from 7.58% to 8.23%) (all P < .001 for trend). The estimated overall Healthy Eating Index 2015 increased from 55.7 to 57.7 (difference, 2.01; 95% CI, 0.86-3.16; P < .001 for trend). Trends in high- and low-quality carbohydrates primarily reflected higher estimated energy from whole grains (0.65%) and reduced estimated energy from added sugars (−2.00%), respectively. Trends in plant protein were predominantly due to higher estimated intake of whole grains (0.12%) and nuts (0.09%).

Conclusions and Relevance  From 1999 to 2016, US adults experienced a significant decrease in percentage of energy intake from low-quality carbohydrates and significant increases in percentage of energy intake from high-quality carbohydrates, plant protein, and polyunsaturated fat. Despite improvements in macronutrient composition and diet quality, continued high intake of low-quality carbohydrates and saturated fat remained.”

Fruit and vegetable consumption and all-cause mortality: a dose-response analysis 

https://doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.112.056119

Published: 26 June 2013  Article history

ABSTRACT

Background:The association between fruit and vegetable (FV) consumption and overall mortality has seldom been investigated in large cohort studies. Findings from the few available studies are inconsistent.


Objective: The objective was to examine the dose-response relation between FV consumption and mortality, in terms of both time and rate, in a large prospective cohort of Swedish men and women.


Design: FV consumption was assessed through a self-administrated questionnaire in a population-based cohort of 71,706 participants (38,221 men and 33,485 women) aged 45–83 y. We performed a dose-response analysis to evaluate 10th survival percentile differences (PDs) by using Laplace regression and estimated HRs by using Cox regression.


Results: During 13 y of follow-up, 11,439 deaths (6803 men and 4636 women) occurred in the cohort. In comparison with 5 servings FV/d, a lower consumption was progressively associated with shorter survival and higher mortality rates. Those who never consumed FV lived 3 y shorter (PD: −37 mo; 95% CI: −58, −16 mo) and had a 53% higher mortality rate (HR: 1.53; 95% CI: 1.19, 1.99) than did those who consumed 5 servings FV/d. Consideration of fruit and vegetables separately showed that those who never consumed fruit lived 19 mo shorter (PD: −19 mo; 95% CI: −29, −10 mo) than did those who ate 1 fruit/d. Participants who consumed 3 vegetables/d lived 32 mo longer than did those who never consumed vegetables (PD: 32 mo; 96% CI: 13, 51 mo).


Conclusion: FV consumption <5 servings/d is associated with progressively shorter survival and higher mortality rates.

This is a better score than that of the anti-aging billionaire Bryan Johnson at 0.71, which puts him in the 96.14% of his age group.

I thought it would be interesting to summarize what diet, exercise and supplements Siim Land follows.

**Diet:**

\- Follows a calorie restricted, high-protein (0.8g protein per pound body weight which is 130-150g/day for him) and well balanced Mediterranean style diet.

\- Early time-restricted feeding diet: He eats 1.5 meals a day with a small protein meal early in the day, followed by a bigger meal in the afternoon (stops eating \~5 hours before bed).

\- Emphasizes polyphenols, fiber (\~30-40g/day), vegetables (3-4 servings/day such as beetroot, cauliflower, broccoli, spinach, carrot), fruits (1-2 servings, such as blueberries, strawberries, cherries, banana and Apple) and starches (like sweet/regular potatoes)

\- Eggs are a staple in his diet and he eats them daily.

\- Eats fish 3 times per week.

\- Eats 1-2/servings/week of red meat. Hunts and cans himself most of his red meat intake.

\- Eats dairy products such as cottage cheese and whey protein powder.

\- Avoid any refined oils and sticks only to extra virgin olive oil.

\- Avoid alcohol completely.

\- Plant protein mostly from Hemp, little peas, lentils and nuts (mostly Brazil nuts).

\- Focuses on natural ingredients without any additives.

\- Drinks green tea and coffee.

\- Limits saturated fats to <10% total calories.

\- Restricts eating window through intermittent fasting/time-restricted feeding - Includes glycine-rich foods and supplements (collagen, gelatin) to get \~15g glycine per day

**Exercise:**

**-** Does 1 high intensity (HIIT) and 2-3 steady state ""Zone 2"" cardio sessions per week

\- Aims for 200 min/week vigorous and up to 800 min/week moderate exercise

\- Does resistance training 3x per week for muscle strength/bone density

\- Gets 8,000-12,000 steps per day through walking

**Other:**

\- Takes antioxidants and may use some synthetics/nootropics

\- Sleeps 7-8 hours per night on average, up to 9 hours when recovering; emphasizes consistent schedule

\- Uses blue-blocking glasses before bed

\- Takes omega-3 supplement

\- Uses sauna 4x per week (15-20 min at 70-80°C)

\- May use glycine supplement after age 40

Full study: [An Integrated Understanding of the Rapid
Metabolic Benefits of a Carbohydrate-Restricted
Diet on Hepatic Steatosis in Humans](http://cyber.sci-hub.tw/MTAuMTAxNi9qLmNtZXQuMjAxOC4wMS4wMDU=/mardinoglu2018.pdf#page=1&zoom=auto,-17,783)

>Highlights

>- A low-carbohydrate diet (LCD) improves liver fat metabolism
in NAFLD patients
- The LCD promotes rapid shifts in the gut microbiota
composition of NAFLD patients
- The LCD-induced microbial changes are associated with
increased circulating folate
- The LCD increases folate-dependent one-carbon metabolism
gene expression in liver

>SUMMARY

>A carbohydrate-restricted diet is a widely recommended
intervention for non-alcoholic fatty liver
disease (NAFLD), but a systematic perspective
on the multiple benefits of this diet is lacking.
Here, we performed a short-term intervention with
an isocaloric low-carbohydrate diet with increased
protein content in obese subjects with NAFLD
and characterized the resulting alterations in metabolism
and the gut microbiota using a multi-omics
approach. We observed rapid and dramatic
reductions of liver fat and other cardiometabolic
risk factors paralleled by (1) marked decreases in
hepatic de novo lipogenesis; (2) large increases in
serum b-hydroxybutyrate concentrations, reflecting
increased mitochondrial b-oxidation; and (3) rapid
increases in folate-producing Streptococcus and
serum folate concentrations. Liver transcriptomic
analysis on biopsy samples from a second cohort
revealed downregulation of the fatty acid synthesis
pathway and upregulation of folate-mediated onecarbon
metabolism and fatty acid oxidation pathways.
Our results highlight the potential of exploring
diet-microbiota interactions for treating NAFLD.

Abstract  

**Objective:**  
  
Menopause represents a period in which bone deterioration is accelerated; thus, primary prevention strategies to address age-related bone loss are crucial. Dairy products contain more than a dozen essential nutrients, including calcium, phosphorus, vitamin D, and high-quality protein, as well as bioactive compounds that may promote bone mineralization. However, the relationship between dairy consumption and bone health across the menopause transition remains largely unknown. The purpose of this analysis was to estimate the change in lumbar spine and femoral neck bone mineral density and the risk of bone fracture by the frequency of dairy intakes among women across the menopausal transition using the publicly available data from the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation.  
  
**Methods:**  
  
We analyzed total dairy foods in four categories of <0.5, 0.5 to <1.5, 1.5 to <2.5, and ≥2.5servings/d or <1.5 and ≥1.5servings/d. A general linear model was used to estimate the association of dairy intake with the 10-year bone mineral density loss rate and a linear mixed model was used to estimate the annualized bone mineral density loss rate of the femoral neck and lumbar spine. A Cox proportional hazard model was applied to calculate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals of the nontraumatic fractures. Poisson regression was used to determine the relative risks and 95% confidence intervals of the nontraumatic fractures. The models were controlled for race/ethnicity, age, height, weight, smoking status, physical activity, alcohol consumption, calcium use, menopausal status, and total caloric intake.  
  
**Results:**  
  
No significant differences in bone mineral density change were observed, regardless of baseline menopausal status. No significant differences in the risk of nontraumatic fracture were observed.

British researchers conducted a study investigating the impact of using a blueberry concentrate or a placebo for 12 weeks in two groups of older adults (averaging 68 years old).

Their focus was on brain blood flow, localized brain activation, and cognition.1

What makes this study unique is that the scientists evaluated subjects’ brain function with a battery of cognitive tests while the subjects were inside a powerful MRI scanner. This allowed the researchers to observe brain activity in real time, while the subjects performed the tests.1

This is called a functional MRI (or “fMRI”), and it allows the researchers to detect the activity of areas of the brain that are in use for specific cognitive functions. They can then correlate that activity with the amount of blood flowing to those brain regions.7

Here are findings from this study revealing how blueberries benefit brain health:

1. Blueberries increased brain activity. Compared to the placebo group, subjects in the blueberry-supplemented group showed significant increases in brain activity while taking the cognitive tests.1 The relevant brain areas were those called upon for performance of each of the tests.

2. Blueberries improved blood flow to the grey-matter brain regions. In the blueberry group, the brain blood flow was significantly improved in the grey matter of the parietal and occipital lobe. This is where sensory, touch, and visual information is processed.1 Such changes were not significant in the placebo recipients.

3. Blueberries improved working memory. The blueberry-supplemented people demonstrated improved working memory compared with those receiving placebo.1 Working memory has to do with holding temporary information, like remembering those five items you needed at the grocery store. It’s also important for decision-making.8

This seminal study revealed in real time the impact of blueberries on cognition in human subjects. It is also the first to link blueberries’ cognitive benefits to specific changes in brain function and blood flow.

One reason this is exciting is because diminished brain blood flow can sometimes be a cause of acute events like strokes. It also underlies more chronic, slowly progressive problems such as mild cognitive impairment, and it is associated with neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s.3-5

This impressive human study shows us that blueberry anthocyanins have the capacity to enhance brain blood flow, potentially preventing further mental decline.1",t2_6m2x7,False,,0,False,Study: blueberries increase brain activity and improve working memory.

>**BACKGROUND**: Increased intestinal permeability (IP) has been implicated in the etiopathogenesis, disease activity and relapse of Crohn's disease (CD). Glutamine, the major fuel for the enterocytes, may improve IP.

>**AIM**: We evaluated the effect of oral glutamine on IP and intestinal morphology in patients with CD.

>**METHODS**: In a randomized controlled trial, consecutive patients with CD in remission phase with an abnormal IP were randomized to a glutamine group (GG) or active control group (ACG) and were given oral glutamine or whey protein, respectively, as 0.5 g/kg ideal body weight/day for 2 months. IP was assessed by the lactulose mannitol excretion ratio (LMR) in urine, and morphometry was performed by computerized image analysis system.

>**RESULTS**: Patients (age 34.5 ± 10.5 years; 20 males) were assigned to the GG (n = 15) or ACG (n = 15). Fourteen patients in each group completed the trial. The LMR [median (range)] in GG and ACG at 2 months was 0.029 (0.006-0.090) and 0.033 (0.009-0.077), respectively, with P = 0.6133. IP normalized in 8 (57.1%) patients in each group (P = 1.000). The villous crypt ratio (VCR) [mean (SD)] in GG and ACG at 2 months was 2.68 (1.02) and 2.49 (0.67), respectively, (P = 0.347). At the end of 2 months LMR improved significantly in GG from 0.071 (0.041-0.254) to 0.029 (0.006-0.090) (P = 0.0012) and in ACG from 0.067 (0.040-0.136) to 0.033 (0.009-0.077) (P = 0.0063).

2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x0000025A147D1460>,,nutrition,"This is something that's been grinding my gears for a while, as someone who used to strive for ethical veganism, who envies the hell out of vegan bodybuilders, and who prefers to minimize risk of atherosclerosis. I've attempted various degrees of plant-based dieting over the years, and have come to the conclusion that a pure plant-based diet, even with a ton of plant-based protein supplements (and supplemental taurine, carnitine, beta alanine, and creatine), is impossible for me. Even now as I'm trying to get as close as possible again, I'm having to consume a very non-trivial amount of whey protein just to avoid the kind of unbearable weakness that I would otherwise experience.

I heard that Michael Klaper was going to take a serious look into this, then I saw a video of him on YouTube saying that basically one ""just has to adjust."" Which is what they all say.

I would much rather someone say that failure to thrive on a vegan diet is the result of some kind of weird metabolic disorder -- granted that assertion were based on sound science. At least then I might know how to take care of myself better, but no. Everyone just says the same BS.

Why is this not taken seriously? If the plant-based community really believed in the health of vegan diets then it seems like they should want to understand why some people cannot maintain good health on them. This just doesn't appear to be the case.

&#x200B;

Edit: here is a comment that I made further down the thread that elaborates on my frustrations if anyone is curious. Link [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/comments/b320nr/why_does_the_vegan_community_including_its/eix5qht/). Comment here:

I cannot find any detailed cases of FTT promulgated by plant-based doctors, who, in all likelihood, have seen such cases. Therefore there are is no widely promulgated advice from plant-based doctors beyond, ""You'll just adapt."" There are no case reports detailing underlying causes of FTT, no labs, no follow-ups with other tests, no resolutions, nothing that I can look at that might give me some sense of what might be going on.

So I have two thoughts as to why this might not exist: 1.) People who try PBD and experience severe enough symptoms do not follow through with PBD and therefore do not seek out any professional help because doing so would be too much of a strain on their lives, so we have no case reports. 2.) The plant-based community, including plant-based doctors, do not provide enough assistance to those trying to transition to a PBD who have significant health problems brought on by transition.

I&#39;ve attempted various degrees of plant-based dieting over the years, and have come to the conclusion that a pure plant-based diet, even with a ton of plant-based protein supplements (and supplemental taurine, carnitine, beta alanine, and creatine), is impossible for me. Even now as I&#39;m trying to get as close as possible again, I&#39;m having to consume a very non-trivial amount of whey protein just to avoid the kind of unbearable weakness that I would otherwise experience.</p>

<p>I heard that Michael Klaper was going to take a serious look into this, then I saw a video of him on YouTube saying that basically one &quot;just has to adjust.&quot; Which is what they all say.</p>

<p>I would much rather someone say that failure to thrive on a vegan diet is the result of some kind of weird metabolic disorder -- granted that assertion were based on sound science. At least then I might know how to take care of myself better, but no. Everyone just says the same BS.</p>

<p>Why is this not taken seriously? If the plant-based community really believed in the health of vegan diets then it seems like they should want to understand why some people cannot maintain good health on them. This just doesn&#39;t appear to be the case.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Edit: here is a comment that I made further down the thread that elaborates on my frustrations if anyone is curious. Link <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/comments/b320nr/why_does_the_vegan_community_including_its/eix5qht/"">here</a>. Comment here:</p>

<p>I cannot find any detailed cases of FTT promulgated by plant-based doctors, who, in all likelihood, have seen such cases. Therefore there are is no widely promulgated advice from plant-based doctors beyond, &quot;You&#39;ll just adapt.&quot; There are no case reports detailing underlying causes of FTT, no labs, no follow-ups with other tests, no resolutions, nothing that I can look at that might give me some sense of what might be going on.</p>

<p>So I have two thoughts as to why this might not exist: 1.) People who try PBD and experience severe enough symptoms do not follow through with PBD and therefore do not seek out any professional help because doing so would be too much of a strain on their lives, so we have no case reports. 2.) The plant-based community, including plant-based doctors, do not provide enough assistance to those trying to transition to a PBD who have significant health problems brought on by transition.</p>

<p>Non-doctors instead say &quot;it&#39;s all in your head&quot; (happened in this thread) refute the person struggling by saying &quot;but the science discounts your anecdote&quot; (happened in this thread) or quote some WHO thing at them and essentially say &quot;what is happening to you should not be happening/you should not exist&quot; (happened in this thread) OR gives a number of solutions which fix PBD transitions for many people but will inevitably fail for others, and the follow-up work to figure out why FTT on PBD never happens because the person trying to transition gets frustrated and gives up. People who experience this kind of thing from the plant-based community are probably not going to follow up with a plant-based doctor. In either case, the work to figure out what went wrong is never done, because the people trying to transition quit.</p>

One of the sheets was this detailed nutrition guide that listed:
1. all the vitamins and minerals your body needs to function properly.
2. the emotional/physical symptoms caused by deficiencies of those specific nutrients.
3. specific foods that provided those nutrients. 

For example, under Vitamin B12 would be a list of food sources such as fish and dairy. Followed by why it’s important for brain function, and a list of deficiency symptoms such as confusion, depression, and fatigue. 

I had a personal copy that I referenced anytime I wasn’t feeling myself (I’m very prone to symptoms of anxiety and depression). I must have lost it while moving out of my college house, and I no longer work at or have access to the hospital where I originally got the guide from. 

I lost a significant amount of weight and saw my mental health vastly improve when I had access to that information. I’m hoping to get back on track and find this guide again to use for meal planning.

I’ve searched Google, Pinterest, and every other site I could think of, hoping to find an online copy of the guide but I’ve had no luck. 

Has anyone seen something similar to this guide and are you able to provide a link? If not, what are some online resources I can use to create my own nutrition sheet with all the information I mentioned above?   

If/when I can find that guide again or access info to create my own, I will gladly post it for all of you to use as well. It is an incredible resource for anyone prone to mental illness and/or trying to eat healthier. And having a simple guide to hang on your fridge or keep in your pocket can be super effective for initiating that change in your life. 

I really appreciate all your help and Im hoping I can reciprocate by providing you all with new information too. Thanks in advance!

**EDIT:**
Thank you all for your interest and suggestions! 

I’ve gotten a lot of great information from the resources you’ve mentioned, and I am still planning on creating a custom guide to share with you all.

I see a lot of you setting reminders, for which I’m assuming is either the original guide I was looking for or the one I said I would make. I’m just a bit busy and haven’t had down time to work on it yet, but I promise I will get to it eventually and share it as soon as it’s finished! 

Until then, there are several wonderful resources for nutrition and health in the comments, so feel free to look over them!

1. all the vitamins and minerals your body needs to function properly.
2. the emotional/physical symptoms caused by deficiencies of those specific nutrients.
3. specific foods that provided those nutrients. </p>

<p>For example, under Vitamin B12 would be a list of food sources such as fish and dairy. Followed by why it’s important for brain function, and a list of deficiency symptoms such as confusion, depression, and fatigue. </p>

<p>I had a personal copy that I referenced anytime I wasn’t feeling myself (I’m very prone to symptoms of anxiety and depression). I must have lost it while moving out of my college house, and I no longer work at or have access to the hospital where I originally got the guide from. </p>

<p>I lost a significant amount of weight and saw my mental health vastly improve when I had access to that information. I’m hoping to get back on track and find this guide again to use for meal planning.</p>

<p>I’ve searched Google, Pinterest, and every other site I could think of, hoping to find an online copy of the guide but I’ve had no luck. </p>

<p>Has anyone seen something similar to this guide and are you able to provide a link? If not, what are some online resources I can use to create my own nutrition sheet with all the information I mentioned above?   </p>

<p>If/when I can find that guide again or access info to create my own, I will gladly post it for all of you to use as well. It is an incredible resource for anyone prone to mental illness and/or trying to eat healthier. And having a simple guide to hang on your fridge or keep in your pocket can be super effective for initiating that change in your life. </p>

<p>I really appreciate all your help and Im hoping I can reciprocate by providing you all with new information too. Thanks in advance!</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong>
Thank you all for your interest and suggestions! </p>

<p>I’ve gotten a lot of great information from the resources you’ve mentioned, and I am still planning on creating a custom guide to share with you all.</p>

<p>I see a lot of you setting reminders, for which I’m assuming is either the original guide I was looking for or the one I said I would make. I’m just a bit busy and haven’t had down time to work on it yet, but I promise I will get to it eventually and share it as soon as it’s finished! </p>

<p>Until then, there are several wonderful resources for nutrition and health in the comments, so feel free to look over them!</p>

<p>Thank you all again for being as invested in your wellbeing as I am. I appreciate your patience and I will update you as soon as I can!</p>

Despite the rising popularity of plant-based alternative meats, there is limited evidence of the health effects of these products.

Objectives
We aimed to compare the effect of consuming plant-based alternative meat (Plant) as opposed to animal meat (Animal) on health factors. The primary outcome was fasting serum trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO). Secondary outcomes included fasting insulin-like growth factor 1, lipids, glucose, insulin, blood pressure, and weight.

Methods
SWAP-MEAT (The Study With Appetizing Plantfood—Meat Eating Alternatives Trial) was a single-site, randomized crossover trial with no washout period. Participants received Plant and Animal products, dietary counseling, lab assessments, microbiome assessments (16S), and anthropometric measurements. Participants were instructed to consume ≥2 servings/d of Plant compared with Animal for 8 wk each, while keeping all other foods and beverages as similar as possible between the 2 phases.

Results
The 36 participants who provided complete data for both crossover phases included 67% women, were 69% Caucasian, had a mean ± SD age 50 ± 14 y, and BMI 28 ± 5 kg/m2. Mean ± SD servings per day were not different by intervention sequence: 2.5 ± 0.6 compared with 2.6 ± 0.7 for Plant and Animal, respectively (P = 0.76). Mean ± SEM TMAO concentrations were significantly lower overall for Plant (2.7 ± 0.3) than for Animal (4.7 ± 0.9) (P = 0.012), but a significant order effect was observed (P = 0.023). TMAO concentrations were significantly lower for Plant among the n = 18 who received Plant second (2.9 ± 0.4 compared with 6.4 ± 1.5, Plant compared with Animal, P = 0.007), but not for the n = 18 who received Plant first (2.5 ± 0.4 compared with 3.0 ± 0.6, Plant compared with Animal, P = 0.23). Exploratory analyses of the microbiome failed to reveal possible responder compared with nonresponder factors. Mean ± SEM LDL-cholesterol concentrations (109.9 ± 4.5 compared with 120.7 ± 4.5 mg/dL, P = 0.002) and weight (78.7 ± 3.0 compared with 79.6 ± 3.0 kg, P < 0.001) were lower during the Plant phase.

Conclusions
Among generally healthy adults, contrasting Plant with Animal intake, while keeping all other dietary components similar, the Plant products improved several cardiovascular disease risk factors, including TMAO; there were no adverse effects on risk factors from the Plant products.”

So I work as support staff in a school UK 
 and sometimes I have to take PSHE l(personal health social and economic) lessons. I was asked to deliver a lesson on nutrition. All of the slide were provided for me... 

One of the slides asked “why is too much fat bad for you?” And the provided answer was “it clogs your arteries”

This really grinded my gears. To say the least. 

by definition TOO MUCH of anything is bad for you. Of course it is. Too much, implies... more than what is healthy. That concept in itself is hard to explain to 11 year olds.(I mean too much water is bad for you because... it’s TOO MUCH)

But I’m so tired of people demonising fat. This PowerPoint slide implied that people should avoid fat. I did not want to send that message to a group of impressionable year 7s. So I told them to ignore it. 

I told them a table spoon of olive oil on a salad or a pat of butter on a potato is much healthier for them than a bottle of coke (which has 0 fat). I hope they took that in. 

I’m sorry, this is rant but the idea that fat causes heart disease and diabetes is so out dated it really annoys me that it is still being taught in schools.

It's one thing when there are conflicting opinions and conclusions regarding some specific area of nutrition.  That's fine and is ideal for participants here to throw back and forth. It's another thing altogether when someone is wholly anti-science.  We're not talking about cases of ""is this a 6 or a 9"", we're talking about cases of ""there are no numbers""

Science is real.  Science is necessary.  This sub is for and about the science of nutrition. While it is not the subreddit's place to enforce a side in disagreements over interpretations of data / studies / research, we feel it is incumbent upon us to address anti-science narratives. 

It is not informative, helpful, or productive when someone comes to this sub and is not engaging in facts, is utterly resistant to providing any facts, is solely reliant on youtube videos as a basis for their claims, and ultimately responds to any debate with conspiracy claims.   A completely fact resistant mindset based on gut feelings and ""somebody dun sed an I dont care who"" is not engaging in good faith whatsoever.

While we sympathize with concerns about corporate interests, it is a problem when folks are coming here to specifically bash any and all science and try to discredit every bit of it with ""funding bias"" and ""Big food and Big pharma"" kinds of comments. THE biggest problem misinformation angle in the nutrition sub are science rejection comments, and not just rejection of some specific thing but those which are actively promoting ""don't trust any science"". 

Again, the science of any specific facet of nutrition is always welcomed to be debated here, it's part of the purpose of the sub, but a debate of the validity of science itself is not.

Therefore, going forward;

* **""Science is a conspiracy"" type engagement is not allowed** - If instead of having a fact based discussion, your purpose here is to engage solely in unsubstantiated conspiracy generalizations and science denial, then you are likely to be banned. If conspiracy claims are your basis for discussion or you wish to question science itself, then you should instead utilize the subreddits which cater to those discussions as it is not on topic for this sub.

* **Automod will be removing certain kinds of anti-science and conspiracy comments**.  This will be very targeted to science denial rhetoric so as to ensure appropriate topical debate is left in place.

* **Any bias concerns need to be *specifically* addressed and cited rather than barfing up generalized funding bias hyperbole**. Pointing out a specific company or companies behind a specific study to express concerns about bias is more than acceptable for discussion here.  Blanket brushing all science / research / studies ever generated for funding bias is ridiculous conspiracy blather and is outside of reality.  It's a step way too far.

In addition to the above, we also ask you to vote accordingly and to let us know when you see

""all science BAD!""

The study is the first meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials examining the health effects of red meat by substituting it for other specific types of foods.

The study was published in the journal Circulation.

“Previous findings from randomized controlled trials evaluating the effects of red meat on cardiovascular disease risk factors have been inconsistent. But our new study, which makes specific comparisons between diets high in red meat versus diets high in other types of foods, shows that substituting red meat with high-quality protein sources lead to more favorable changes in cardiovascular risk factors,” said Marta Guasch-Ferré, research scientist in the Department of Nutrition and lead author of the study.

The study included data from 36 randomized controlled trials involving 1,803 participants. The researchers compared people who ate diets with red meat with people who ate more of other types of foods (i.e. chicken, fish, carbohydrates, or plant proteins such as legumes, soy, or nuts), looking at blood concentrations of cholesterol, triglycerides, lipoproteins, and blood pressure—all risk factors for CVD.

The study found that when diets with red meat were compared with all other types of diets combined, there were no significant differences in total cholesterol, lipoproteins, or blood pressure, although diets higher in red meat did lead to higher triglyceride concentrations than the comparison diets. However, researchers found that diets higher in high-quality plant protein sources such as legumes, soy, and nuts resulted in lower levels of both total and LDL (“bad”) cholesterol compared to diets with red meat.

The results are consistent with long-term epidemiologic studies showing lower risks of heart attacks when nuts and other plant sources of protein are compared to red meat, the authors said. The findings also suggest that the inconsistencies found in prior studies regarding the effects of red meat on cardiovascular risk factors may be due, in part, to the composition of the comparison diet. They recommended that future studies take specific comparisons into account...

The authors recommended adherence to healthy vegetarian and Mediterranean-style diets, both for their health benefits and to promote environmental sustainability.”

They recommended that future studies take specific comparisons into account...</p>

<p>The authors recommended adherence to healthy vegetarian and Mediterranean-style diets, both for their health benefits and to promote environmental sustainability.”</p>

An estimated 80110 (95% uncertainty interval [UI]: 76316-83657) new cancer cases were attributable to suboptimal diet, accounting for 5.2% (95% UI: 5.0%-5.5%) of all new cancer cases in 2015. Of these, 67488 (95% UI: 63583-70978) and 4.4% (95% UI: 4.2%-4.6%) were attributable to direct associations; and 12589 (95% UI: 12156-13038) and 0.82% (95% UI: 0.79%-0.85%) to obesity-mediated associations. By cancer type, colorectal cancer had the highest number and proportion of diet-related cases (52225, 38.3%). By diet, low consumption of whole grains (27763, 1.8%) and dairy products (17692, 1.2%) and high intake of processed meats (14524, 1.0%) contributed to the highest burden. Men, middle-aged (45-64 years), and racial/ethnic minorities (non-Hispanic blacks, Hispanics, and others) had the highest proportion of diet-associated cancer burden than other age, sex, race/ethnicity groups.

So, large parts of the world, especially the eastern world, eat white rice as a major staple food, probably 2-3 meals a day.

The common wisdom though is you should generally avoid white rice because it is pretty much just an empty carb.

For the sake of argument, to eliminate places where white rice may be a staple purely because it is cheap and available in places that may not have fantastic access to foods, let's consider Japan. They're as modern as anywhere else and have pretty high availability of nutritious foods too. They also, though, still probably have white rice with every meal.

<p>So, large parts of the world, especially the eastern world, eat white rice as a major staple food, probably 2-3 meals a day.</p>

<p>The common wisdom though is you should generally avoid white rice because it is pretty much just an empty carb.</p>

<p>For the sake of argument, to eliminate places where white rice may be a staple purely because it is cheap and available in places that may not have fantastic access to foods, let&#39;s consider Japan. They&#39;re as modern as anywhere else and have pretty high availability of nutritious foods too. They also, though, still probably have white rice with every meal.</p>

EDIT: I realise now that I've misled people into possibly thinking fruit is bad. I'm very sorry for that. This is not true. Fruit is very good! Fruit is nutritious, contains fiber and has not been correlated with cardiovascular disease! Eat your fruit! In fact even carbohydrates are good as long as you don't eat too many refined carbohydrates! He isn't saying carbs are bad, he's essentially saying refined sugars like candy and soda is bad. Don't take any facts in the title or the following body of text as fact until you've watched the video! Or ignore it altogether, up to you.

He goes into the data on the correlation between high fructose low fat diets and obesity, why fiber is good, why and how people are getting sick using the standard American diet. He also explains the biochemistry on how fructose is processed in the liver the same as ethanol. The USDA essentially regulates acute poisons and ignores chronic poisons such as fructose.

It is pretty known that Insulin Resistance is caused by constant spikes in glucose which forces the pancreas to create more insulin which eventually leads to insulin resistance.

Foods that cause high spikes in glucose are high on the Glycemic Index. These includes bagels, sugary drinks, potatoes etc.

How come my coworker wouldn’t eventually develop insulin resistance? He doesn’t have any of the risk factors, though. He’s in shape (healthy weight range) and goes to the gym (but he’s not very consistent)

I visit friends and family and there is a bag of chips, or cookies, or other junk on the counter most times, and tons more filling the cupboards. I’ve found similar in most offices I’ve worked in.</p>

<p>These same people then beat themselves up about how they can’t control their appetite, over eat, and gain weight. But we’re all human, if you leave snack food sitting in plain sight all day, of course you’re going to want to eat it. Willpower can only take you so far when constantly bombarded with signals of easy food.</p>

<p>So I started to think today, maybe the ubiquity of snack food is one of the biggest drivers of the obesity epidemic. I can’t imagine people snacked all that much in the past. Most of what is considered snack foods are pretty modern inventions.</p>

Here's the Psychology Today's [article](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/evolutionary-psychiatry/201803/low-cholesterol-and-suicide-again) on low cholesterol and suicide:

>Despite these reasonable suppositions, many studies over decades have (for the most part) consistently linked low total serum cholesterol with suicide, violence, and depression. Total cholesterol levels below 160, and especially below 130, correlate with a higher risk of mental problems.

&#x200B;

>Those with hypocholesterolemia were over *four times* more likely to have major depressive disorder, and over *five times* more likely to have attempted suicide. In fact, half the suicide attempters had a total cholesterol of less than 150

&#x200B;

>Specifically, lower cholesterol seems to directly impair the function of the 5HT-1A receptor, the most common serotonin receptor in the brain. Activators of this receptor tend to decrease anxiety,  among other downstream effects relating to many other neurotransmitters  that can affect depression and neuron recovery and repair. Low  serotonin activity in the central nervous system  has long been known to correlate with violence and suicide. This means  that cholesterol depletion in the brain could plausibly lead to poor  serotonin signaling and subsequent increased risk of suicidal behaviors.

And here's a [summary](https://veganhealth.org/cardiovascular-disease-markers-in-vegans/) of studies analyzing vegan cholesterol levels:

>Between 1980 and 2002, cholesterol levels of vegans living in Western  countries was measured in 17 studies. The average cholesterol level of  vegans was 160 compared to 202 mg/dl for non-vegetarians. Table 2 shows  the results.

&#x200B;

>Of the 17 studies in Table 2, five were of vegans living in the USA.  Of those studies, the lowest average finding for total cholesterol for  vegans was 135 mg/dl. The data from all 5 studies is compiled in Table  3. The total cholesterol of the 135 vegans averaged out to 146 mg/dl.

And here is the mortality [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26657045) from U.K (n=60k) which showed that in the vegetarian and vegan diet groups there was a higher risk of dying from mental health related causes than in the other groups studied which were regular meat eaters, low meat eaters and fish eaters.

My observations:

Michael Greger - Lots of info on how plant based foods can have different effects, good look at how different healthy foods can have different effects (such as blueberries limiting a blood sugar spike), BUT biased when it comes to animal products, seems to refuse to recognize any positive benefit of animal products. However he also seems to be the least profit-oriented out of any of these people, for what it's worth.

Rhonda Patrick - Lots of good info about how bad sugar is, how good intermittent fasting is, and has lots of good info in general, but too focused on ""biohacking"" (using supplements to ""deal with"" different problems)

Peter Attia- Seems passionate but he's got his head way too far up his own ass. I want to learn what this guy has to offer but he spends so much time talking about nothing that I end up feeling like he's mainly talking just to boost his own ego and prove to himself that he's so smart.

Estrogen produced by aromatization of gonadal androgen has an important facilitative role in male-typical aggressive behavior that is mediated through its interaction with estrogen receptors (ER) in the brain. Isoflavones found in soybeans and soy-based dietary supplements bind ER and have dose- and tissue-dependent effects on estrogen-mediated responses. Yet, effects of isoflavone-rich diets on social and aggressive behavior have not been studied. We studied the effects of long-term (15 months) consumption of diets rich in soy isoflavones on spontaneous social behavior among adult male cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) (n = 44) living in nine stable social groups. There were three experimental conditions which differed only by the source of dietary protein: casein and lactalbumin (no isoflavones), soy protein isolate containing 0.94 mg isoflavones/g protein, and soy protein isolate containing 1.88 mg isoflavones/g protein. In the monkeys fed the higher amount of isoflavones, frequencies of intense aggressive (67% higher) and submissive (203% higher) behavior were elevated relative to monkeys fed the control diet (P's < 0.05). In addition, the proportion of time spent by these monkeys in physical contact with other monkeys was reduced by 68%, time spent in proximity to other monkeys was reduced 50%, and time spent alone was increased 30% (P's < 0.02).
